📊 Data Analytics Project – End-to-End Analysis & Dashboarding
📌 Overview

This project demonstrates a complete data analytics workflow, starting from data loading and exploration to database querying and business insight visualization.
The goal is to extract meaningful insights from raw data using Python, SQL, and Power BI, and present the results in a clear and professional manner.


📂 Dataset

Source: (Public / Company / Kaggle / Internal – update as needed)

Format: CSV

Description: The dataset contains structured data used for analytical exploration, trend identification, and reporting.



🛠 Tools & Technologies
